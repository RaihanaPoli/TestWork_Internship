For this work I took MVC project. So basically there are two files:
  Controller: HourConsumtionController.
  Views/HourConsumption: index.
In view Form I use grouped (days, weeks, months) so that user can select one to get specific data of consumption history.
And the data will presented to the user in a table according to the selected filters. The date will not be up to two years in the past.If so then it will give user a warn popup.
In form there is an option to give kW/h price which will multiply with hour wise consumption and display the total price of consumption.
The results are sent to the front-end in structural format using AJAX
